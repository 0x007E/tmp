# `TMP` - Temperature Warning (Temperaturwarnung)

The `TMP` is a board with an [LM358](#additional-information) or any other 2-channel operational amplifier. The board itself is driven with a voltage of `5V`. It converts the temperature (0¬∞ - 100¬∞) from an [KTY81/210](#additional-information) to a voltage. This voltage can be coupled onboard with a Schmitt-Trigger to change the status of the connected LEDs (`green`, `red`).

Optional the converted temperature can be digitalized through an A/D converter and sent to a terminal through UART. A demo how this can be done is attached and can be tested with an [ATmega16A](#additional-information).

# Hardware

The pcb is created with `KiCAD`. All files are built with `github actions` so that they are ready for a production environment.

## PCB

The circuit board is populated on one side. The best way for soldering the `SMD` components is within a vapor phase soldering system and for the `THT` components with a standard system.

# Configuration

To configure the `TMP` some reference voltages needs to be modified. The reference of `TP2` has to be around `~1V` and is adjusted through `RV1`. On `J2` the [KTY81/210](#additional-information) should be connected. To setup the amplification a mutimeter with temperature measurement function is needed. The voltage on `TP3` can be calculated through the following equation:

$U_{TP3}=\frac{2.5}{100}*ùúó+1$

Calculate $U_{TP3}$ with the current temperature and setup the voltage on `TP3` to the calculated value with `RV2`. The Equation is Designed for the following parameters:

| $U_{TP3}/[V]$ | Temperature $ùúó/[¬∞C]$ |
|:--------:|:-------------------------:|
| 1        | 0                         |
| 3.5      | 100                       |

On Jumper `J3/1` the generated voltage from the captured temperature can be measured. To connect the temperature measurement to the warning system jumper `J3` has to be shorten.

With `RV3` the limit to generate a state change of the leds can be set to a value between `2¬∞` to `98¬∞`. With `RV4` the hysteresis of the Schmitt-Trigger can be adjusted.

# Software

The demo firmware (`ATmega16A`) of the `TMP` can be used to digitalize the voltage with an A/D converter and transmit the data over uart to a terminal.
